This folder contains the average reconstruction errors computed with the hvEEGNet trained with 80 epochs
There is a file for each subject of the dataset 2a.
For more info about the computation read section 3.3 of the paper [hvEEGNet: exploiting hierarchical VAEs on EEG data for neuroscience applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00799)
