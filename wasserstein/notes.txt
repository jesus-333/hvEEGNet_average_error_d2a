This files contains the wasserstrain distance computed with the data of dataset 2a of BCI Competition IV.
The distribution used is the one created by the latent space of hvEEGNet

We first encode the train data (i.e. the data of a single specific subject used to train our model).
Then we computed the distance between this projecton on the latent space and the projecton of the data of other subjects.
Session 1 refers to the train data of the other subjects.
Session 2 refers to the test data of the other subjects.

In the mu folder the distance is computed between the the mean of the distribution (i.e. since z is a guassian distribution mu is the array of the mean)
In the latent_space_samples the distance is computed from the sample of the distribution (i.e. p(z|x))
